# Basic pagination model

This is a basic Maven-based Java project created with the use of the [Library Maven Archetype](https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/library-maven-archetype). It will ease the development of new libraries, setting it up for CI through the use of free services: [Github](https://github.com/), [Github Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows), [Github Packages](https://github.com/features/packages) and [OSS Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/).

Before beginning with the new project there are a few things which should be edited:

- This readme's description has to be adapted to the new project.
- Project info on the POM should be checked.
- The various links on the readme, POM and Maven site (for repositories, issues, etc) should be verified.
- The documentation on the project's [Maven Site](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-site-plugin/) has to be written.
- The license, if not using the MIT one, should be changed. Remember that this is referenced on the POM, readme and LICENSE files.

Note that the Maven site is using the [Docs Maven Skin](https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/docs-maven-skin), which will have a few configuration requirements of its own.

## Features

The project by default comes with a useful series of features:

- Preconfigured POM to begin developing a new library fast.
- Prepared for [Github Workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows), including configuration files and deployment scripts. Check the [Archetype documentation](https://docs.bernardomg.com/maven/library-maven-archetype) to find out more.
- Unit and integration tests suites ready to be run with [JUnit](https://junit.org) just by using the Maven test and verify commands.
- A Maven site, using the [Docs Maven Skin](https://github.com/Bernardo-MG/docs-maven-skin), to contain the documentation, the Javadocs and several reports.
- A bunch of useful files, such as readme, gitignore and gitattributes.

## Usage

The application is coded in Java, using Maven to manage the project.

It is a Java library, meant to be included as a dependency on any project which may want to make use of it.

### Installing

The recommended way to install the project is by setting it up as a dependency. To get the configuration information for this check  the [Maven Central Repository][maven-repo].

It is always possible installing it by using the usual Maven command:

```
mvn install
```

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

### Issues management

Issues are managed at the GitHub [project issues tracker][issues], where any Github user may report bugs or ask for new features.

### Getting the code

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the [GitHub project page][scm], where the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.
